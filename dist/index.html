    <p>This force network simulates flow between states. </p>
    <p>Each particle represents one "subject" or "object" in an experiment or simulation. It moves along the path that was created in the simulation (see particle-paths.csv). The simulation will reset after it completes, or within 5 seconds. You can double click to isolate one node.</p>
